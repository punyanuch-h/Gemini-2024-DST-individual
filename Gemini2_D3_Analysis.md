## Use Case: Operate the Interactive Observing (Virtual Telescope)
*Use Case Name:* Operate the Interactive Observing (Virtual Telescope)  
*ID:* 3
*Important Level:* Medium  
*Primary Actor:* Astronomer  
*Stakeholder and Interest:*
- *Astronomer* requires a simulated observation experience.
- *System Administrator* ensures virtual telescope performance.

*Brief Description:*
The astronomer interacts with a virtual telescope to simulate observations.

### Normal Flow of Events
1. The astronomer starts the interactive observing mode.
2. The astronomer adjusts settings such as focus, zoom, and positioning.
3. The astronomer initiates a test observation.
4. The system displays the simulated observation results.
5. If the astronomer closes the interactive observing mode, the system stops the operation and exits the session.

### Subflows
4.1 If fine-tuning is needed, the astronomer returns to step 2.
### Alternate/Exceptional Flow
- *If the system loses connection to virtual telescope data,* the session is paused, and the user is notified.

## Use Case: Submit a Science Plan
*Use Case Name:* Submit a Science Plan  
*ID:* 4
*Important Level:* High  
*Primary Actor:* Astronomer  
*Stakeholder and Interest:*
- *Astronomer* ensures that the plan is successfully submitted for execution.
- *Research Institutions* rely on submitted plans for scheduling observations.

*Brief Description:*

- *Type:* User-initiated

*Relationships:*  
- *Association:* Astronomer  
- *Include:* -  
- *Extend:* -  
- *Generalization:* -  

### Normal Flow of Events
1. The astronomer selects a validated science plan.
2. The system checks for required approvals.
3. The astronomer submits the plan.
4. The system confirms submission and schedules the observation.

### Subflows
